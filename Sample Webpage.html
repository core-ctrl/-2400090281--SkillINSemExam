    <h2> Branching </h2>
    <p> Branching is a powerful feature in Git that allows you to create separate lines of development within a repository. Each branch can have its own set of changes, which can be worked on independently without affecting the main codebase. This is particularly useful for developing new features, fixing bugs, or experimenting with ideas without disrupting the stable version of the project.</p>
    <h2> Merging </h2>
    <p> Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. When you merge a branch, Git combines the changes made in that branch with the target branch, allowing you to incorporate new features or fixes into the main codebase. Merging can be done using various strategies, and Git will attempt to automatically resolve any conflicts that arise when changes overlap.</p>
